Studies show that coronary heart disease (CHD) is responsible for around 382,820 fatalities each year in USA, while approximately  697,000 individuals face the risk of heart disease annually. It is not better in Australia, and CHD is a leading cause of death in Australia. Deaths from CHD represent 78,052 years of potential life lost in Australia. Hence, detecting heart condistions early on is very imprtant to prevent them happening or encouradge high-risk peoples to make changes in their lifestyles  or habbits to minimize potential risks.

In this study, my goal is to identify the key factors contributing to heart disease and develop a predictive model for estimating the overall risk of heart disease using logistic regression analysis.

I used the Heart Disease Framingham dataset which is accessible on Kaggle for this analysis. It derives from an ongoing cardiovascular study conducted in Framingham, Massachusetts.
