## Credit Risk Modelling (Random Forest, XGBoost models)

**Project Link:**<a href="https://github.com/dilruu89/Kaggle/blob/main/01-credit-risk-modeling.ipynb" target="_blank">Credit Risk Modelling Jupyter Notebook</a>

**Project Description:** 

This project focuses on credit risk modeling, which is the process of assessing the likelihood that a borrower may default on a loan, which can lead to financial losses for lenders. Using machine learning techniques, the project explores how customer data can be analyzed to evaluate credit risk profiles. The key goal is to determine whether models like Random Forests and XGBoost can accurately predict the probability of default and help quantify the potential impact of such defaults.

By leveraging a Kaggle dataset, the project aims to improve risk assessment and support better decision-making in lending practices.

The dataset includes variables that mimic real-world credit bureau information, providing a realistic foundation for modeling. Features are tailored to reflect factors influencing credit risk, aiding in the creation of predictive models.

### Techniques/ Algorithms / Metrics

In the initial phase, I applied various data analysis methods and visualization techniques. Subsequently, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), selected relevant features,  built and chose models, and evaluated them. Following are the techniques that I mainly used in this project.

1. Random Forest
2. XGBoost ((Extreme Gradient Boosting))
3. Cross Validation
4. Hyper Parameter tunning
