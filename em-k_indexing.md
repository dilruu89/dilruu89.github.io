**Project description:** In various data mining and analysis projects that involve managing and processing extensive data collections, achieving accurate and efficient entity resolution (ER) poses a significant challenge. ER involves integrating data to identify matching entities, and this task becomes especially crucial when dealing with large datasets. The need for swift responses to entity queries on substantial databases is becoming more prevalent in real-world applications.

A particularly demanding scenario arises in applications where entity queries need to be matched against extensive reference databases promptly. We term this the "query matching problem" in ER. To address this issue, we introduce an approach that focuses on indexing techniques, seeking to decrease search space and execution time during the ER process. Notably, our focus is on approximate indexing methods that are amenable to scaling for very large datasets.

In summary, our work addresses the challenge of efficient entity resolution in the context of large-scale datasets. We tackle the query-matching problem by introducing an indexing technique that leverages spatial mappings, Kd-trees, and nearest neighbor search. Our method shows promise in terms of scalability, efficiency, and practical applicability, as demonstrated through experimental evaluations on different datasets.
